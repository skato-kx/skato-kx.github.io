## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at **Knox College**, majoring in **Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics**.  
My main interests lie in **machine learning for physical systems**, including **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, and **simulation-based AI**.  
I plan to pursue graduate studies starting in **2027**, with a focus on bridging physics and artificial intelligence.

## Projects
- **[PINN Paper Implementation and Summary](https://skato-kx.github.io/PINNs-research.github.io/)**  
  A beginner-friendly walkthrough of PINNs based on Raissi et al.'s foundational paper, with my own implementation and notes.
- **[GCN Paper Implementation and Summary](https://skato-kx.github.io/gcn-research.github.io/)**  
  A structured summary and simple implementation of Kipf & Wellingâ€™s Graph Convolutional Networks.
- **[Spectral Convolution Paper Implementation and Summary](https://skato-kx.github.io/spectral-convolution-research.github.io/)**  
  A structured summary and simple implementation based on Bruna et al.'s pioneering work on spectral graph convolution.
- **[Fourier Neural Operator](https://skato-kx.github.io/fno-research.github.io/)**  
  A structured summary and simple implementation based on Zongyi Li's pioneering work on fourier neural operator.
- **[Ice-Cube GNN Implementation](https://github.com/skato-kx/ice-cube-gnn)**  
  My implementation using GNN for a past kaggle competition.
